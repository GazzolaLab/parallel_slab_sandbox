# Parallel Slab Benchmark Sandbox

An online sandbox to play around with an elasto-hydrodynamic benchmark problem to test coupled FSI algorithms.

> :rocket: The online sandbox can be seen [here](https://gazzolalab.github.io/parallel_slab_sandbox/).

The numerical code (written in `Python`) powering the simulator [can be found here](https://github.com/tp5uiuc/parallel_slab).

## What is it?
An online simulation of a setup that employs an elastic solid layer sandwiched between two fluid layers, in turn confined by two long planar walls. The walls' oscillations drive a characteristic system response which can be analytically computed.
